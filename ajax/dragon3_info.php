  <span class="title-head">Adding details to the upper body and overall mesh.</span> <br><br />
 
    <p>I am now focusing in this part of the project on large and small details, folds in the skin as well as blending with areas with less wrinkles in making sure that certain areas in the skin has a good amount of folds mostly in the neck and chest area, also keep in mind that the overall anatomy is still consistent in the mesh. Now there’s a good amount of detail here for my dragon I’m satisfy with this version of the model.</p><br>
