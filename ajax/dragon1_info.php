    <p>Work-in-progress page for my<span class="title"> Sorcerer</span> Controller and his <span class="title">Dragon</span>. The layout creative process about three weeks during my spare time most of the materials was well plan, a good amount of studies were put into the anatomy of this project as well as asset development in a very short period of time I hope you like. Take care.</p><br>
   <span class="title-head">Sorcerer Controller and his Dragon, release final.</span><br>
   <br>
    <p>The final release combine both the dragon and his master sorcerer including all the asset and positioning them together, the story behind this piece is pretty interesting as it reflects early Egyptians history of a “Sorcerer Controller and his Dragon” . The over view process for my Sorcerer Controller and his Dragon from concepts to clay marquette sculpting to the early blocking stages, below are some of the creative curves that went into this project. Thanks for viewing. </p>
