    <p>Many steps was taken here during this part of the project. The final details for my dragon head sculpture involving a bit more artistic abilities when implementing folds and wrinkles around the eyes, lower jaw, and areas of mouth. At the same time referring back to references for realistic flow in the skin. Thanks for viewing.</p><br>
